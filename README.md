really just learning how i am using github

I see that people work individually on their respective computer, on their local workstations, and then "pull" and "push" all the files to upload to the git!

Let me test with this currnet linked hackmd.io

This file is now maintained directly inside hackmd, and push-pull on the "learning repo".

I am trying to link another hackmd.io file, that will be the reposotories that is the NAS directories and nameing convention for my personal databse usage!!!

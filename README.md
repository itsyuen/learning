Now syncing through HackMD.io, using user tsyuen@gmail.com.

All detailed management is documented here, along with the most important "leaning to survive lab", using the brand new toolchian:

1. hackmd + github
2. matlab/simulink + ROS toolbox
3. Embedded coder inside matlab/simulink + c/c++ opp
4. speed goat simulink with simscape comparison
5. CubeIDE/Arduino using Embedded RTOS with interrupts
6. Ubuntu/Linux with ROS2 using c++ cmake for robotics projects
7. NAS organization with cloud sync for collaboration

currently add all figures here on GitHub.

This file is now maintained directly inside hackmd, and push-pull on the "learning repo".

I am trying to link another hackmd.io file, that will be the reposotories that is the NAS directories and nameing convention for my personal databse usage!!!
